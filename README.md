# Image-Classification-Streamlit

### Data Collection
 Here I have used <b> Bing Image API </b> for collecting the data from bing search engine.
 
### Data Preprocessing
I have flatten the image data in to 1D array to feed the model.

### Model Building
In this part, I have selected the SVM classification algorithm to classify my images into certain classes. Also I have performed Hyperparameter Tuning on my model. I used GridSearchCV to tune the model.

### Streamlit
For the web application part, I used Streamlit library. I have created a webapp with the help of Streamlit and it worked well.
